               <h3>About The Policy</h3>
               <p>
                  At dndprofessionals, the privacy of our clients is our top priority on
                  www.dndprofessionals.com and we respect it as our own. Though we collect information from our
                  clients, it is only used to make improvements in our customer services. Our company acknowledges
                  that the maintenance and use of our clients' information is our responsibility. We DO NOT rent
                  or sell the information that our clients provide us online.

                  This policy describes how the personal information of our client collected by us is used, why we
                  collect it, and how we use it. It is within our policy that we describe the choices you can make

                  or mailing addresses which we receive through our mailing system such as our Contact Us Form for
                  responding to comments, queries etc.

               <p>
                  We use credit card processing companies to bill you for services. These companies do not retain,

               <h3>Security of Personal Information</h3>
               <p>
                  The information of our clients is secure, as it is protected during transmission by the use of
                  the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Software which encrypts the information the client puts in.
               </p>
               <p>
                  We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to
                  us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the
                  Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive
                  to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee
                  its absolute security.

               <h3>Cookies and Their Use</h3>
               <p>
                  Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to the clients' hard drives through
                  their Web browsers. This enables our systems to recognize the clients' browsers and storage of
                  items in their Shopping Carts during visits.
               </p>
               <p>
                  The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will be more helpful in explaining how to
                  prevent the browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify the user when a
                  new cookie is received, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take
                  full advantage of the top features at our site, and our company's personal recommendation is
                  that the client leaves them to be accepted.
